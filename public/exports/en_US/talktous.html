<h3>Got a problem or an idea? We can help!</h3>
<p>
    We are still very busy refining the ActiveInbox experience, striving for the perfect balance of high
    utility and minimal features.
</p>
<p>
    Everything we have done so far has been with the community's support and suggestions, and we want you
    to feel absolutely comfortable getting involved too. If you have any requests, opinions or just want
    to discuss something, then please come and get in touch.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.getsatisfaction.com/activeinbox" target="_blank">Community Forum</a><br/>
        We like to keep as much discussion in the open as possible, as it brings together the best ideas and helps
        the largest number of people. We spend most of our support time in the Community Forum.
        Oh, and if you want to help others we'd love for you to come and share your tips and advice!
    </li>
    <li>
        Email us at <a href="mailto:support@activeinboxhq.com">support@activeinboxhq.com</a>.<br/>
        If you have a more private matter, or you want to give us a little kick to remind us about something,

<h3>Advanced Stuff</h3>

<h4>
    Error Reporting: There are <span id="gtdi-error-reporter-count">0</span> ActiveInbox warnings
</h4>
<p>
    <button id="gtdi-error-reporter-submit">Send the Warnings to the Team</button><br/>
    This will enable us to diagnose them and get things fixed. (Please note this is an automatic submission process
    and normally we cannot reply. We
    use the blog to announce new releases that we make with your feedback).
</p>

<h4>Snapshot Gmail HTML</h4>
<p>
    <button id="gtdi-snapshot-html">Send Gmail Layout Information to the Team</button><br/>
    If you are helping us fix a problem, we'll let you know how to use this! Please note it is possible that
    it will send your emails or subject lines (because it sends whatever you are currently viewing), but we do a good job
    of cutting 99% of the personal content out of what is sent to us. And as an extra precaution, we delete everything
    as soon as we've finished analysing it. If you're not comfortable, please do not use this button.
