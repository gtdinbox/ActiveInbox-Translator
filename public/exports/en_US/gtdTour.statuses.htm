        By giving emails Status you can track actionable emails that you must do,
        track things that you are waiting for, and effortlessly keep them all on your radar (but out
        of your inbox!) until they are completed.

        ActiveInbox helps you do as much as possible <em>within</em> Gmail. For 80% of your little email tasks it does not make sense to move them to
        another task or project manager, they can just be handled in the one system where you spend most of your day: Gmail.
