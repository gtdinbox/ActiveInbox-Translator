        <h3>Get Email Under Control</h3>
        <p>
            Emails are just badly formatted tasks!
        </p>
        <p>
            Use email statuses, project folders and time-saving shortcuts to stay on top of your email.
            <!--Clean out your inbox, turn emails into trackable actions, organize them into manageable projects and get everything done faster.-->
            <!--, that is the foundation that ActiveInbox is built upon. Manage the emails you send and receive as a <em>flow</em> of actions, separated into projects, and achieve easy control of <em>everything</em> in your Gmail. -->
        </p>

        <h3>Get Your Work Done</h3>
        <p>
            <!--Truly effective control of Gmail helps you escape from your email, <em>freeing your mind</em> to focus on getting real work done.-->
            <!--The end result is that you are free to focus on the work that is most important to you while staying in control of your inbox.-->
            The end result is that your mind is free to focus on your important work rather than your email. 
        </p>
         
        <p style="display:none">
            And here's the really cool bit: because email inboxes are a source of friction, and everytime an email passes through someone it slows down the
            flow of communication, if everyone on your team achieves control and efficiency in email then work gets done a lot more smoothly.
            <!--when everyone you know also takes control of their email you can come together as a team. Because email inboxes are a source of friction, where
            requests get held up or forgotten, and when everyone achieves control and efficiency communication flows effortlessly between team mates.-->
