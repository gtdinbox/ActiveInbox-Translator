  <h3><a href="http://www.getsatisfaction.com/activeinbox" target="_blank">Community Forum</a></h3>
  <p>We like to keep as much discussion in the open as possible, as it brings together the best ideas and lets us riff on them.</p>

            If you are helping us fix a problem, we'll let you know how to use this! It takes a snapshot of your
            current view of Gmail, to help us find unique changes in your version. We do everything possible to strip out
            your personal information (like email addresses), but some things do slip through. To counter this, we delete
            everything you submit as soon as we've finished analyzing it. If you're not comfortable, please do not use this button.
