        An empty inbox gives you a lovely relaxed feeling <em>and</em> ensures you are always on top of your important emails.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        How do you achieve it? Every few hours, for each email in your inbox:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose how to act:
            <ul>
                <li>Delete or spam it if you can</li>
                <li>Reply if you can do so within 2 minutes (to move it forward)</li>
                <li>If it will take longer, action and prioritize it (give it a Status) and come back when you can dedicate yourself to processing all emails</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Archive it and move to the next email (you can do this with just one click!).
        </li>
    </ol>
