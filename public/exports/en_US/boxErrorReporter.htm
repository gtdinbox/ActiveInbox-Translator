        I cannot respond to every error report that comes in, but each one contributes to getting it fixed and released on the

            If you are helping us fix a problem, this takes a snapshot of your
            current view of Gmail, to help us find unique changes in your version. We do everything possible to strip out
            your personal information (like email addresses), but some things do slip through. To counter this, we delete
            everything you submit as soon as we've finished analyzing it. If you're not comfortable, please do not check this (but it is EXTREMELY helpful!).
